# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are in the initial project setup phase of the Attio Integration API, focusing on defining the project architecture and establishing the core integration patterns for connecting Attio CRM, Zoho, and Braintree.

## Recent Changes

- Created project plan (PLAN.md)
- Established Memory Bank documentation structure
- Defined core project requirements and integration patterns
- Researched API capabilities for all three platforms
- Updated project documentation to use pnpm instead of npm
- Cleaned up .cursor/rules file to remove irrelevant content

## Active Decisions

1. **Database Strategy**:

   - Decision: Use Attio objects as source of truth, avoid separate database
   - Status: Confirmed
   - Rationale: Simplifies architecture, reduces infrastructure needs, and keeps data synchronized

2. **Deployment Platform**:

   - Decision: Use Render.com for serverless deployment
   - Status: Confirmed
   - Rationale: Easy setup, GitHub integration, environment variable management, and webhook compatibility

3. **Integration Approach**:

   - Decision: Webhook-driven architecture with API fallbacks
   - Status: In consideration
   - Rationale: Real-time updates are critical for subscription status synchronization

4. **Authentication Strategy**:

   - Decision: Environment variable storage of API credentials
   - Status: Confirmed
   - Rationale: Secure, follows best practices, and supported by Render.com

5. **Package Management**:
   - Decision: Use pnpm instead of npm
   - Status: Confirmed
   - Rationale: Faster installation, better dependency management, and disk space efficiency

## Current Challenges

1. **Attio Data Model**: Determining optimal structure for storing subscription data in Attio objects
2. **Webhook Security**: Implementing proper signature verification for all incoming webhooks
3. **Zoho API Authentication**: Setting up OAuth flow with refresh token management
4. **Testing Strategy**: Creating a test environment that simulates the three-platform interaction

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)

1. Set up basic Express API project structure with pnpm
2. Create service files for each integration (zohoService.js, attioService.js, braintreeService.js)
3. Implement basic webhook endpoints for each platform
4. Configure environment variables in development environment

### Short-term (This Week)

1. Implement Attio API client for object creation/updates
2. Set up Zoho OAuth authentication flow
3. Configure Braintree sandbox environment
4. Create basic service synchronization from Zoho to Attio

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)

1. Implement complete webhook handling for all platforms
2. Build subscription trigger flow from Attio to Braintree
3. Create comprehensive testing scenarios
4. Deploy test version to Render.com

## Current Questions

- What specific fields are needed in the Attio Services collection?
- What is the expected volume of subscriptions/transactions?
- Are there any existing Zoho webhooks already configured?
- What level of reporting is required for subscription status?
