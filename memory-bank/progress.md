## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing the plan processing workflow and preparing for Braintree integration:

1. Testing and refining the /process-plan endpoint
2. Documenting the plan processing workflow
3. Preparing for Braintree integration by collecting necessary plan data
4. Setting up a cron job or scheduled task for automatic synchronization
5. Adding update logic for existing plans (not just creation)
6. Implementing incremental synchronization to improve efficiency
7. Starting work on the Braintree payment links integration
8. Creating the subscription creation flow

## Blockers

- Need confirmation on the preferred frequency for Zoho-Attio synchronization
- Awaiting Braintree sandbox account setup
- Need to verify Braintree payment links functionality in our account

This document will be updated as the project progresses to reflect the current state of development.
