## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing the plan processing workflow, preparing for Braintree integration, and planning the client-facing frontend:

1. Testing and refining the /process-plan endpoint
2. Documenting the plan processing workflow
3. Preparing for Braintree integration by collecting necessary plan data
4. Setting up a cron job or scheduled task for automatic synchronization
5. Adding update logic for existing plans (not just creation)
6. Implementing incremental synchronization to improve efficiency
7. Starting work on the Braintree payment links integration
8. Creating the subscription creation flow
9. Planning the EJS frontend implementation
10. Preparing for proposal and quote view templates

## Blockers

- Need confirmation on the preferred frequency for Zoho-Attio synchronization
- Awaiting Braintree sandbox account setup
- Need to verify Braintree payment links functionality in our account
- Need detailed requirements for the client-facing proposal and quote views

This document will be updated as the project progresses to reflect the current state of development.

## Dependencies to Add

- E-signature library (to be selected)
- PDF generation library
- Email service integration

## Notes

- Currently using Tailwind CSS for styling
- EJS templating system in place
- Static assets need to be added (images, etc.)
