# Project Brief: Attio Integration API

## Core Purpose

A custom API integration that connects Attio CRM with Zoho for service/subscription management and Braintree for payment processing. This replaces the previous Betterseller app and serves as a bridge between these platforms.

## Primary Goals

1. Create a seamless integration between Attio, Zoho, and Braintree
2. Eliminate the need for a separate database by using Attio objects as source of truth
3. Enable service subscription management through Attio
4. Handle complete subscription/billing lifecycle with proper synchronization
5. Provide webhook endpoints for real-time updates between systems

## Success Criteria

- Successful sync of services from Zoho to Attio
- Users can trigger subscriptions from Attio interface
- Proper handling of billing and subscription lifecycle events
- Real-time status updates across all connected platforms
- Seamless migration from Betterseller app with no data loss

## Key Stakeholders

- CRM Team (Attio users)
- Finance/Billing Team (Zoho users)
- End customers (subscription holders)

## Timeline and Priorities

1. Set up API infrastructure and deployment on Render.com
2. Implement Zoho integration for service offerings
3. Implement Attio integration for data storage and triggers
4. Implement Braintree integration for payment processing
5. Establish webhook communication between services
6. Testing with sandbox environments
7. Production deployment and monitoring

This integration will serve as the backbone for subscription management as we transition from Betterseller to the Attio ecosystem.
