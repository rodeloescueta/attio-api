# Product Context

## Business Background

The company is transitioning from a Betterseller app to Attio CRM as the primary customer relationship management platform. This migration necessitates a new integration solution to connect Attio with the existing Zoho subscription system and Braintree payment processing.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Platform Fragmentation

- **Before**: Separate systems for CRM, subscription management, and payments with manual reconciliation.
- **After**: Integrated ecosystem with automated data flow and synchronization.

### 2. Data Silos

- **Before**: Customer data spread across multiple platforms with no single source of truth.
- **After**: Attio serves as the central data store, with synchronized data from Zoho and Braintree.

### 3. Subscription Management

- **Before**: Service offerings managed in Zoho but disconnected from the CRM experience.
- **After**: Service offerings visible within Attio, with subscription triggers directly from the CRM.

### 4. Payment Processing

- **Before**: Manual payment status updates between systems.
- **After**: Automated payment event handling with real-time status updates across platforms.

## User Experience Goals

### For CRM Team (Attio Users)

- View all available service offerings within Attio
- Trigger new subscriptions directly from Attio interface
- See real-time subscription and payment status for customers
- Manage the entire customer lifecycle within one platform

### For Finance Team (Zoho Users)

- Maintain service definitions and pricing in familiar Zoho environment
- Receive automatic updates when new subscriptions are created
- Maintain billing oversight while reducing manual processes

### For Customers

- Seamless subscription experience
- Transparent billing process
- Uninterrupted service during platform migration

## Key Workflows

3. **Billing Events**

This integration represents a critical component in the company's platform modernization strategy, enabling a more streamlined and efficient customer management process.
